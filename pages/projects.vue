        This is  a web application which build for a simple clothes retail store named 
        Shiganshima. This web application is built to practice the <span>role-based access 
        control (RBAC), authentication and authorization</span> in Laravel. Besides that, 
        it also built for me to  be more familiar with Laravel and itâ€™s not make for 
        any commercial purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CRUD operation in this web application are interacted within the database 
        in local machine. There are three roles in this web application which are member 
        customer, non-member customer and admin. The actions they can perform and 
        the views they can see are different depending to their roles.
